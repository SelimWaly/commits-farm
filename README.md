# GitHub Commits Farm
A program that will farm and create commits on your GitHub account.

## Introduction
This project was created simply to farm GitHub commits on your account for 3 reasons:
<br>
1. Keep your account active.
2. Look cool.
3. Flex on your friends the fact that your life is just non-existent.

## Results
A long time ago I have create a very simple version and these were the results:
<br>
<br>
![112,000 commits on GitHub](src/results.jpg)

## How it works?
You might wonder what is the formula used by this program
<br>
This program does a simple operation using the built-in Python module `random` to generate a random integer from 1 to 10.
After choosing a number, if the number is 1, 2 or 3 it waits 15 seconds then chooses another number.
The rest of the numbers correspond to a progrmamming language that the program writes a simple script with to output "Hello, world!" then publish the file on GitHub with the name Temp- then a random salt then the file type of that programming language.
<br>
Here are the programming languages the numbers correspond to:
<br>
<br>
4. C++
<br>
5. C
<br>
6. Python
<br>
7. Jupyter
<br>
8. JavaScript
<br>
9. TypeScript
<br>
10. Brainfuck
<br>

## How to use
Using this program is very simple.
If you look in the files of this repository you will find a file called `main.py` containing the code.
All you have to do is create an empty folder, create a python file inside of it and insert the code, then run it using any Python interpreter.
WARNING: DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT IN THE DESKTOP OR ANY DIRECTORY SIMILAR TO THAT. PLEASE CREATE A FOLDER DEDICATED TO THIS FARM TO PREVENT ISSUES WITH YOUR COMPUTER OR RANDOM FILES APPEARING ON YOUR COMPUTER.
